      <h2>Restaurant Website Project</h2>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>This responsive website was a project that was inspired by my love for Thai food and my parents.
              The website was created for anyone interested in Thai food.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>The idea of this project came to me during a time I missed being near my parents.
              This project is dedicated to my parents for showing their love through cooking.
              It is intended to function as website where people can learn about the restaurant and its food.
              I wanted to work on a project where I could improve my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p><b>Problem</b> -  A problem I noticed with some restaurant websites is how outdated, cluttered, and unorganized they can be.
          Too much information or options can be overwhelming to users.
          A second problem I found was how unresponsive some restaurant websites were if they were viewed from a mobile device.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> - My goal was to create a beautiful, user-friendly website for a Thai restaurant.
          I wanted users to be able to easily view the food, the menu, and easily find where to order online. I went with a minimal, modern approach and tried to only include features users needed.
          To keep the website beautiful on mobile devices, I made the website responsive for different screen sizes.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Process and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>The first step I took was creating a brand for the restaurant.
          I chose to create a Thai restaurant website because my mom loves to cook.
          I picked the restaurant to specialize in northeastern Thai food because that is where my mom is from.</p>

        <p>
          The restaurant was named after my dad, whose name translates to golden lion.
          Sing Khao would translate to “Lion Food” in English.
          I used gold as an accent color, which is a lucky color in Thailand.
          Ultimately, I used my dad’s name in two different ways to create a brand.</p>

        <p>I picked fonts and paired colors that were easy to read.
          Black is used as a background color to feel modern and sophisticated.
          Red was chosen as a primary color because it is known in some Asian cultures to be a lucky color.
          It is also known to evoke hunger or feelings of passion and love.
          The red lion logo was created in Procreate after I sketched a drawing on paper.</p>

        <p>Next, I structured my content with HTML for all web pages.
          Then, I styled the website with CSS and used grids to create columns for certain parts of the website.
          Finally, functionality was created using JavaScript.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Challanges & Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Some challenges I faced were differences in how the website looked between browsers because some code was not compatible for a few of them.
          I had to alter the design of the website in some ways than what I preferred.
          My goal is for the future is to be able to find more creative solutions around those issues.
          I hope to be able to make my designs more interactive and fun with more animations.
