            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>This responsive website was a project that was inspired by my love for Thai food and my parents.
              The website was created for anyone interested in Thai food.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>The idea of this project came to me during a time I missed being near my parents.
              This project is dedicated to my parents for showing their love through cooking.
              It is intended to function as a restaurant website for people interested in Thai food.
              I wanted to work on a project where I could improve my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p><b>Problem</b> -  A problem I noticed with some restaurant websites is how outdated, cluttered, and unorganized they can be.
          Too much information or options can be overwhelming to users.
          A second problem I found was how unresponsive some restaurant websites were if they were viewed from a mobile device.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> - My goal was to create a beautiful, user-friendly website for a Thai restaurant.
          I wanted users to be able to easily view the food, the menu, and easily find where to order online. I went with a minimal, modern approach and tried to only include features users needed.
          To keep the website beautiful on mobile devices, I made the website responsive for different screen sizes.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Process and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>The first step I took was creating a brand for the restaurant.
          I chose to create a Thai restaurant website because my mom loves to cook.
          I picked the restaurant to specialize in northeastern Thai food because that is where my mom is from.</p>

        <p>
          The restaurant was named after my dad, whose name translates to golden lion.
          Sing Khao would translate to “Lion Food” in English.
          I used gold as an accent color, which is a lucky color in Thailand.
          Ultimately, I used my dad’s name in two different ways to create a brand.</p>

        <p>I picked fonts and paired colors that were easy to read.
          Black is used as a background color to feel modern and sophisticated.
          Red was chosen as a primary color because it is known in some Asian cultures to be a lucky color.
          It is also known to evoke hunger or feelings of passion and love.
          The red lion logo was created in Procreate after I sketched a drawing on paper.</p>

        <p>Next, I created structured my content with HTML for all web pages.
          Then, I styled the website with CSS and used grids to create columns for certain parts of the website.
          Finally, functionality was created using JavaScript.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Challanges & Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Some challenges I faced were differences in how the website looked between browsers because some code was not compatible for a few of them.
          I had to alter the design of the website in some ways than what I preferred.
          My goal is for the future is to be able to find more creative solutions around those issues.
          I hope to be able to make my designs more interactive and fun with more animations.
