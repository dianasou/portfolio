            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Carver Jewels is a shopping app for everyday fine jewelry intended for people who enjoy simple luxuries or buying gifts for someone special in their life.
              The design process consisted of a mobile-first approach that transitioned to responsive designs, user testing, and a mobile prototype.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create designs for a shopping app based on the branding I established in the beginning.
              Research shows that fewer people are downloading apps, and I find that especially true for stores.
              I knew that I wanted to design my app as a responsive web app that would be scalable in larger screen sizes.
              This was my final project for my CareerFoundry course.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p><b>Problem</b> -  Some shopping apps can have the problem of being confusing or cluttered, which makes users want to leave the store.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> - My goal was to design a shopping app that is inviting, easy to use, and user-centered.
          I aimed for the design to be clean, bright, and minimal.
          That would allow users to focus on their tasks or product details.
          Some key features I included was allowing users to access inventory without an account, having sale items viewable for users to save money, and including a variety of payment options.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p>From the beginning, I established brand guidelines to utilize throughout the project to keep the product consistent.</p>

        <p>I created a user flow for 3 user stories.</p>

          <img class="thumbnail" id="floating-img" src="img/carverjewels/carverjewels_user_flow@2x.png" alt="User Flow">
        </picture>

        <ul>
          <li><b>User Story 1</b>
            <br>
            As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to register, so that I can make sure this store has what I’m looking for before having to create an account.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li><b>User Story 2</b>
            <br>
            As a customer, I want to be able to see when stock is on sale, so that I can save money.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li><b>User Story 3</b>
            <br>
            As a customer, I want there to be a variety of payment options, so that I can choose the payment method that suits me best.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>Low to mid-fidelity wireframes were designed based on my third user flow where users can view their different payment options.
          That user flow was chosen because it included user flows 1 and 2 to make the app feel more complete.</p>
        <br>

        <div class="grid">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carverjewels/carverjewels_lowfidelity@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img class="thumbnail" src="img/carverjewels/carverjewels_lowfidelity@2x.png" alt="Low-Fidelity Wireframes">

          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carverjewels/carverjewels_midfidelity@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img class="thumbnail" src="img/carverjewels/carverjewels_midfidelity@2x.png" alt="Mid-Fidelity Wireframes">
          </picture>
        </div>

        <p>User tests were completed and I gained valuable feedback about how the user flow could be improved.
          I discovered another way users prefer to view payment options by accessing their account information.
        <p>
        <p><b>Scenario</b> - You are a new user shopping for jewelry and would like to view your payment options.
          Which steps would you take to accomplish this task?</p>

          <img class="thumbnail" id="floating-img-2" src="img/carverjewels/carverjewels_cause@2x.jpg" alt="Our Cause Mockup">
        </picture>

        <p>Feedback from the user test was implemented in my high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

        <p>I was challenged to figure out how to make my app stand out.
          I researched some well-known jewelry stores and found that one based in Austin gives back to women and children’s health and education.
          That inspired me to add a screen titled Our Cause to show how a purchase can help children in the foster care system.
          I thought it was a nice addition to the design as an incentive to buy a product because it can help a good cause.</p>

        <p>Finally, I created designs for remaining responsive screens for larger devices.
          Since my app was designed as a responsive web app, scaling the designs to a larger size was made easier.</p>
