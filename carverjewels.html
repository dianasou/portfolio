        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Overview:</h3>
          <p>Carver Jewels is a shopping app for everyday fine jewelry.
            It is intended for people who enjoy simple luxuries or buying gifts for someone special in their life.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Purpose:</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this project was to create designs for a shopping app based on the branding I established in the beginning.
            Research shows that fewer people are downloading apps, and I find that especially true for stores.
            I knew that I wanted to design my app as a responsive web app that would be scalable in larger screen sizes.
            This was my final project for my CareerFoundry course.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Objective:</h3>
          <p><b>Problem</b> -  Some shopping apps can have the problem of being confusing or cluttered, which makes users want to leave the store.</p>
          <p><b>Solution</b> - My goal was to design a shopping app that is inviting, easy to use, and user-centered.
            I aimed for the design to be clean, bright, and minimal.
            That would allow users to focus on their tasks or product details.
            Some key features I included was allowing users to access inventory without an account, having sale items viewable for users to save money, and including a variety of payment options.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Role & Duration:</h3>
          <p>1 week</p>
          <ul>
            <li>UI Designer</li>
            <li>UX Designer</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Tools:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sketch</li>
            <li>Marvel App</li>
            <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Process:</h3>
          <p>From the beginning, I established brand guidelines to utilize throughout the project to keep the product consistent.</p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Brand Guidelines@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </picture>
          <br>

          <p>I created a user flow for 3 user stories.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><b>User Story 1</b>
            <br>
            As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to register, so that I can make sure this store has what I’m looking for before having to create an account.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>User Story 2</b>
            <br>
            As a customer, I want to be able to see when stock is on sale, so that I can save money.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>User Story 3</b>
            <br>
            As a customer, I want there to be a variety of payment options, so that I can choose the payment method that suits me best.</li>
          </ul>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - User Flow@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - User Flow@2x.png" alt="User Flow">
          </picture>
          <br>

          <p>Low to mid-fidelity wireframes were designed based on my third user flow where users can view their different payment options.
            That user flow was chosen because it included user flows 1 and 2 to make the app feel more complete.</p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Low-Fidelity@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Low-Fidelity@2x.png" alt="Low-Fidelity Wireframes">
          </picture>
          <br>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Mid-Fidelity@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Mid-Fidelity@2x.png" alt="Mid-Fidelity Wireframes">
          </picture>
          <br>

          <p>User tests were completed and I gained valuable feedback about how the user flow could be improved.
            I discovered another way users prefer to view payment options by accessing their account information.<p>
          <p><b>Scenario</b> - You are a new user shopping for jewelry and would like to view your payment options.
            Which steps would you take to accomplish this task?</p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - User Test Results@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - User Test Results@2x.png" alt="User Test Results">
          </picture>
          <br>

          <p>Feedback from the user test was implemented in my high-fidelity wireframes.</p>
          <br>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Final Screens@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Final Screens@2x.jpg" alt="Final Screens">
          </picture>
          <br>

          <br>
          <p>I was challenged to figure out how to make my app stand out.
            I researched some well-known jewelry stores and found that one based in Austin gives back to women and children’s health and education.
            That inspired me to add a screen titled Our Cause to show how a purchase can help children in the foster care system.
            I thought it was a nice addition to the design as an incentive to buy a product because it can help a good cause.</p>
          <br>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Our Cause@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/carver jewels/Carver Jewels - Our Cause@2x.jpg" alt="Our Cause Mockup">
          </picture>
          <br>

          <br>
          <p>Finally, I created designs for remaining responsive screens for larger devices.
            Since my app was designed as a responsive web app, scaling the designs to a larger size was made easier.</p>
