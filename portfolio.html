            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>I created a portfolio website to showcase my design skills to employers and clients who would like to get to know me better.
              This website was designed and built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>The purpose of the project was to learn how to build and design a website for anyone interested in my designs or is looking for a designer to hire.
              This frontend project was part of my CareerFoundry course.</p>

        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p><b>Problem</b> -  I was looking to create a portfolio website that would allow my designs to be the main focus.
          This website provides a way for anyone interested in my designs to view my projects, resume, and learn about me as a person and designer in one place.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> - I aimed for my website to be minimal and easy to use.
          Creating a portfolio website with a minimal design would make it easier for employers and clients to navigate through my website to get to know me and my design abilities.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p>First, I learned how to use HTML and CSS to structure my website and design a layout for my portfolio. I designed the website with a mobile-first approach.</p>

        <p>At first, the home page had a basic layout with a project image on the left and a text description on the right.</p>

        <p>When I started to learn advanced CSS, I created an animation of an image that was created by someone on Freepik.
          I chose to animate that specific image to hint that I reside in Austin Texas.</p>

        <p>I used Sketch to create mid-fidelity wireframes, which helped me determine the visual inconsistencies between my iOS and Android platforms.</p>

        <p>Finally, when I started to learn Javascript I was able to make the website more responsive. </p>

        <p>I implemented CSS grids to organize my project images in columns and rows on the home page to create a minimal design.
          Users would be able to read a short description of the project and its process when they hovered over a project image.
          It reduced clutter and allowed my projects to be the main focus.
          *insert image of hover effect</p>

        <p>I learned to make better use of space on my project pages by creating thumbnail images that would show up in a lightbox where users could better preview images that were part of my design process.
          *insert sample lightbox image</p>

        <p>An active button was set for the page users currently are on to make it easier for people to know where they are on the website.
          *insert image</p>

        <p>A back-to-top button was created to allow users to smoothly navigate back up a page quicker.
          *insert image</p>

        <p>User testing allowed me to find issues and ways to improve the website.
          I utilized the feedback to provide a better user experience by taking into consideration user behavior and the many ways users could be viewing my portfolio.
          *insert user test results</p>

        <p>Code quality and cross-browser testing allowed me to ensure that my website was scaled correctly and was not throwing errors.
          The functionality of my website was tested on Google Chrome, Apple’s Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.
          I correctly some code that would be more compatible with more browsers to allow my website to run smoothly and provide an improved user experience.
          *insert cross-browser test results</p>
