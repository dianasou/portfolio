      <h2>Portfolio Website Project</h2>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>I created a portfolio website to showcase my design skills to employers and clients who would like to get to know me better.
              This website was designed and built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>The purpose of the project was to learn how to build and design a website for anyone interested in my designs or is looking to hire a designer.
              This frontend project was part of my CareerFoundry course.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p><b>Problem</b> -  I was looking to create a portfolio website that would allow my designs to be the main focus.
          This website provides a way for anyone interested in my designs to view my projects, resume, and learn about me as a person and designer in one place.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> - I aimed for my website to be minimal and easy to use.
          Creating a portfolio website with a minimal design would make it easier for employers and clients to navigate through my website to get to know me and my design abilities.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Process and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>I learned how to use HTML and CSS to structure my website and design a layout for my portfolio.
          The website design started with a mobile-first approach.
          At first, the home page had a basic layout with a project image on the left and a text description on the right.</p>

        <picture class="project">
          <source srcset="img/portfolio/mobile@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img id="floating-img" src="img/portfolio/mobile@2x.jpg" alt="Mobile Mockup">
        </picture>

        <p>When I started to learn more advanced CSS, I created an animation of an image that was created by someone on Freepik.
          I chose to animate an image of Austin, Texas to hint at where I reside.</p>

        <p>When I started to learn Javascript I was able to make the website more responsive. </p>

        <p>I implemented CSS grids to organize my project images in columns and rows on the home page to create a minimal design.
          Users would be able to read a short description of the project when they hovered over a project image.
          It reduced clutter and allowed my projects to be the main focus.</p>

        <p>I learned to make better use of space on my project pages by creating thumbnail images that would show up in a lightbox where users could better preview images that were part of my design process.</p>

        <p>An active button was set in the navigation to make it easier for people to know where they are on the website.</p>

        <p>User testing allowed me to find issues and ways to improve the website.
          I utilized the feedback to provide a better user experience by taking into consideration user behavior and the many ways users could be viewing my portfolio.</p>

        <p><b>Usability Report:</b></p>
        <p>Participants found that my website is clean and showed how creative I am. They felt it was easy to use and understand.</p>
        <div class="grid" id="put-left">
          <ul>
            <li class="list-title">Problem</li>
            <li>Users can only click View Project button</li>
            <li>Chopped text and unnatural gap on medium screen size</li>
            <li>User wants easier access to email</li>
            <li>About is an unclear tab name</li>
            <li>Copyright date was incorrect</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li class="list-title">Solution</li>
            <li>Make project images clickable when hovered</li>
            <li>Fix floating image in medium size screen</li>
            <li>Add email at bottom of page</li>
            <li>Change About to About Me</li>
            <li>Update copyright year to be current year</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Code quality and cross-browser testing allowed me to ensure that my website was scaled correctly and was not throwing errors.
          Color accessibility was checked and all colors used on the website were updated to be AA compliant.
          The functionality of my website was tested on Google Chrome, Apple’s Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.
          I updated some of my code to be more compatible with more browsers to allow my website to run smoothly and provide an improved user experience.</p>

        <p><b>Cross-Browser Issues:</b></p>
        <div class="grid">
          <ul>
            <li class="list-title">Problem</li>
            <li>Unnatural text gap caused by floating image on medium screens for all browsers</li>
            <li>Project text is same color as links on mobile devices</li>
            <li>Lightbox image is cut off when user clicks some images</li>
            <li>Copyright text and email on different lines on mobile</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li class="list-title">Solution</li>
            <li>Decreased max-width of floating images to 400px in medium screen media query</li>
            <li>Override the link color and make text #212121</li>
            <li>Update Lightbox image css to max-width: 50% and max-height: 75%</li>
            <li>Decrease copyright and email text in mobile to 10px</li>
          </ul>
