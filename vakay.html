            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>This project is a combination of user experience research and responsive designs for a location-based app. I ultimately chose to implement the location features for a vacation rental company.
              The app is for young to middle-aged adults who like to travel and discover unique places to stay.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to perform user research before designing the user interface to gain a better understanding of the user’s behaviors and needs.
              My designs started as a mobile-first approach to focus on features users needed.
              Then, I was able to design the rest of the responsive screens.
              This two-part project was part of my CareerFoundry course.</p>

        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p><b>Problem</b> -  With my user research, I found that people wanted an app that was reliable and not confusing or overwhelming to use.
          They do not want to feel like they are going to be scammed or have to look too long for a good deal.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> - My goal was to design a customizable, user-friendly, location-based app for a vacation rental company.
          I aimed for the app to be clean and easy to navigate for users to feel relaxed about finding a vacation property.
          I also wanted to list the best matches for properties first based on the user’s preferences, because some users booked last-minute trips while others did it in advance.
          I aimed for users to be able to browse properties quickly to save time.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p>The first steps I took were analyzing vacation rental app competitors Airbnb, and Vrbo. This gave me an insight into potential users and the strengths and weaknesses of each app.</p>

        <p>I learned about user psychology and found them throughout those competing apps to help me understand typical user behavior and expectations.</p>

        <p>Next, I conducted user research on people that would use vacation rental apps.
          That was an essential step to discovering who I would be designing for, what tasks they would likely complete, when and where users would be using the app, as well as why they would use the app.</p>

        <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> Users want to be able to easily browse without having to go through too many property options, save money, and find a place that meets their needs.</p>

        <p><b>Results:</b> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The participants typically travel at least twice a year.</li>
          <li>They like to stay at a hotel or house during vacation.</li>
          <li>All of them mentioned that price is an important thing they consider when booking a place to stay.</li>
          <li>“I never used Airbnb. I want to, but I’m scared to be scammed.”</li>
          <li>“I use Airbnb because it is easy.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> People want to use apps or websites that have reasonable prices and are easy to use.</p>

        <p>The user research helped me create user personas that would guide my design decisions throughout the process based on their needs and behaviors.</p>

        <p>I created user flows to map out the user's journey throughout the app.</p>

        <p>Low-fidelity wireframes were sketched using a mobile-first approach to focus on hierarchy and essential features.
          To complete user testing, mid-fidelity wireframes were created.</p>

        <p>A second round of user testing was conducted to determine how well the app performed.
          I gained insight into how I could improve my design to make the app more user-friendly.</p>

        <p><b>Goal:</b> The goal of this test is to assess the usability of my product. I would like to observe if the new users understand the purpose of the app, how to find a property to reserve for vacation, and measure how many errors are made.
        </p>

        <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>How easy is it for users to search and customize the filter to browse properties?</li>
          <li>How easily can users find the rating and reviews for a property?</li>
          <li>How easily can users contact a property host?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Tasks:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You want to find a place to stay during vacation. Perform a search and customize your results for rental properties.</li>
          <li>You want to find out more about people’s experiences with a property. View reviews for a property.</li>
          <li>You want to ask a question about a property. Send a message to the property host.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Results:</b></p>
        <div class="grid-triple">
          <ul>
            <li class="list-title">Task 1</li>
            <li>All users were confused at first about how the prototype worked. They were able to complete the task.</li>
            <li>Users were unsatisfied with not being able to see information for the next property.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li class="list-title">Task 2</li>
            <li>User 1 and user 2 were able to complete the task seamlessly.
              User 3 found the review previews, but struggled to find access to the screen.</li>
            <li>Users were unsatisfied with not being able to see compelte reviews.</li>
            <li>User 3 did not like the placeholder text, and wanted real life examples.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li class="list-title">Task 3</li>
            <li>All users completed the task without any issues.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p><b>Solutions:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The screen for the property information will be increased to include more information for the next property</li>
          <li>Complete reviews will be available to be viewed by users</li>
          <li>Placeholder text can be replaced with better text that seems relevant</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I created a mood board that is inviting, playful, and elegant.</p>

        <p>The color palette evokes feelings of luxury, romance, and relaxation.
          The fonts feel classy and clean.
          Purple brings a feeling of uniqueness, which I wanted to be a reflection of the unique properties users can find on the app.</p>

        </div>

        <p>I applied grids for each breakpoint and created a style guide to follow to maintain consistency throughout my designs.</p>

        <p>Finally, I created the final screens and a presentation mockup that included all of my different breakpoints for the responsive app.</p>
