            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>This website was created for anyone that would want to learn more about pottery or what a pottery business offers.
              It is a responsive website that was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>This project was created to advertise and inform users about a business that offers people lessons.
              I felt that a pottery business website would be great because it feels artsy and creative.

        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p><b>Problem</b> -Â  A problem that I found was some pottery websites were not visually appealing for a business that is usually for creative people.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b> - My goal was to create a beautiful, user-friendly website.
          I wanted to create a layout that is a little more unique than I have tried before. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Process and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>My first steps included trying to create some branding for the business.
          For headers, I picked a classic serif font that is clean and classy.
          For the body, I picked a sans-serif font that is playful, but still easy to read.
          A shade of black and white was paired as my background color and font color. Peach puff and terracotta were used as secondary colors.
          They are friendly and welcoming colors. Terracotta is also a color people may associate with pottery.
          It is especially a trendy color right now.
        </p>

        <p>Next, I created HTML to stucture my web pages.
          I styled the pages with CSS and created breakpoints for various screen sizes.
          I opted to use a background image that covers a portion behind the home page.
          It peeks through just at the beginning of the page with a typewriter effect quote.
          It acts as an attention grabber to bring interest to users.
          Another feature I included was an underline from the center for the navigation links during hovering.
          There is a drop-down menu for events separated by monthly events and workshops.
          In reality, there would be text on the monthly events pages with the dates of the events.
          I excluded that on the website to keep it relevant because dates too far out are strange and past dates seem outdated.
          On the bottom of the home page, there is a grid of 3 for different services offered.
        </p>

        <p>Functionality for the hamburger menu navigation for mobile screens was built with JavaScript.
          The navigation menu is pulled out from left to right of the screen.
          A slideshow on the About page includes a slideshow that functions using JavaScript.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Challanges & Takeaways:</h3>
          There were problems with the background image that affected the layout of specific pages and screen breakpoints.
          Most of the problems were solved by doing research and experimenting firsthand.
          I learned to keep trying.
          I wanted to give up on using a background image, but I am glad I stuck with it because it gives the page a nice decoration that showcases beautiful pottery.
